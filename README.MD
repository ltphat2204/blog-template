# BLOG Template

Blog template is powered by [Gin-gonic](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) for backend and [Reactjs](https://react.dev/) for frontend. In term of database, MySql was chosen for personal purpose of learning [GORM](https://github.com/go-gorm).

**Key features**:

1. Backend

- HTTP Basic Authentication for authenticating admin user with JWT
- CRUD action with users
- CRUD action with blog post
- CRUD action with categories
- List out and make new subcribers

2. Frontend

- Landing page for displaying principal blog information (banner, top 6 recent blogs, brief description, subcribe)
- About page to show information of the author
- Contact page to send letter to the author (developing)
- Blog page to list out all blogs with filter and search
- Admin page to manage what is going on the web (developing)
